# States That Have It
A demo interactive U.S. map built with Highcharts Maps (Highmaps.js), visualizing state-level sample data that indicates which states “have it” (Yes/No) through pattern-filled color coding. Tooltips provide concise descriptions on hover for desktop users, while Bootstrap modals present detailed information on click for “Yes” states. On mobile devices, hover interactions are disabled for accessibility, making the modal the primary method of exploration.
