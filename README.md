# States That Have It
An interactive U.S. map data visualization demo built with Highcharts Maps (Highmaps.js), showcasing state-level sample data that indicates which states "have it" (Yes/No) through pattern-filled color coding. Tooltips provide concise descriptions on hover for desktop users, while Bootstrap modals display detailed information on click for "Yes" states. On mobile devices, hover interactions are disabled for accessibility, making the modal the primary method of exploration.
